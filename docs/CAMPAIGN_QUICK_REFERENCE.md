## 📊 Check Campaigns

### View Active Campaigns
```sql
SELECT 
  title, status, placement,
  (incentive->>'limit')::int - (incentive->>'redeemed')::int AS spots_left,
  (metrics->>'views')::int AS views,
  (metrics->>'clicks')::int AS clicks
FROM campaigns
WHERE status = 'Active'
  AND placement IN ('landing_page', 'both')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Count Campaigns by Status
```sql
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM campaigns
GROUP BY status;
```

## 🔍 Verify System

### Quick Health Check
```sql
-- Tables exist?
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name IN ('campaigns', 'system_config');

-- Functions exist?
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname IN ('increment_campaign_metric', 'increment_campaign_source');

-- Admin users?
SELECT email, role FROM users WHERE role = 'admin';
```

### Full Verification
```bash
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
sql/verify-campaign-system.sql
```

---

## 📈 Track Metrics

### Increment View
```sql
SELECT increment_campaign_metric(campaign_id, 'views', 1);
```

### Increment Click
```sql
SELECT increment_campaign_metric(campaign_id, 'clicks', 1);
```

### Increment Traffic Source
```sql
SELECT increment_campaign_source(campaign_id, 'facebook', 1);
```

## 💰 Incentive Calculations

### Credits
```
1 credit = €0.50
30 credits = €15.00
100 credits = €50.00
```

### Spots Remaining
```
spots_left = limit - redeemed
Example: 100 - 42 = 58 spots left
```
